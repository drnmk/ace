;; Contain Yourself
;; Difficulty: Easy
;; Topics: The contains? function checks if a KEY is present in a given collection. This often leads beginner clojurians to use it incorrectly with numerically indexed collections like vectors and lists.
;; (contains? #{4 5 6} __)
;; (contains? [1 1 1 1 1] __)
;; (contains? {4 :a 2 :b} __)
;; (not (contains? [1 2 4] __))

(contains? #{4 5 6} 6) ;; => true
(contains? [1 1 1 1 1] 3)  ;; => true
(contains? {4 :a 2 :b} 2) ;; => true
(not (contains? [1 2 4] 0)) ;; => true
